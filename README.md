Instructions for running the program:    

In the command line, first navigate to the folder that contains the python program. Then use the python/python3 command (depending on the python version you have) followed by the name of the program, chat.py, and then the desired port number to run it. For example, you would type 'python3 chat.py 6543' and hit enter to run.
